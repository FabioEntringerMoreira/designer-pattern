/**
 * The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that
 * "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."[1] The term actor refers to a group
 * (consisting of one or more stakeholders or users) that requires a change in the module.
 *
 * Robert C. Martin, the originator of the term, expresses the principle as,"A class should have only one reason
 * to change".
 * Because of confusion around the word "reason" he has also clarified saying that the "principle is about people.
 * In some of his talks, he also argues that the principle is, in particular,about roles or actors.
 * For example, while they might be the same person,the role of an accountant is different from a database
 * administrator.
 * Hence, each module should be responsible for each role.
