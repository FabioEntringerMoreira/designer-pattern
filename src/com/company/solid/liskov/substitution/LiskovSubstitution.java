/**
 * The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral
 * subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1988 conference keynote address
 * titled Data abstraction and hierarchy.
 * It is based on the concept of "substitutability" â€“ a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object
 * (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class)
 * without breaking the program.
 * It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability
 * of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular.
