/**
 * In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle is a specific methodology for
 * loosely coupling software modules.
 * When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level,
 * policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent
 * of the low-level module implementation details. The principle states:
 *
 * High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules.
 * Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
 * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
